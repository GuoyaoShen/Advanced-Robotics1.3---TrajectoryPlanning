# Advanced-Robotics1.3---TrajectoryPlanning
Matlab Simulation, combine Controller (1.1), PathFinding (1.2) and TrajectoryPlanning

Use 'main.m' as a start script.

Trajectory Generator use 5th interpolation (min jerk), also test 7th interpolation (min snap) (in 'project floder') non-stopping solution. Together with other methods such as "Time Filter" and "Same Direction within Threshold Detection".
